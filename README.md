# Kanban App

## This app allows users to create tasks and drag them within three buckets: To-Do, in progress and completed.

## Tools

### REACT

```shell
npx create-react-app kaban-app
cd kaban-app
npm run start
```

### REACT-DRAGGABLE

```shell
npm install rect-draggable
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
